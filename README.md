Practical Machine Learning Modelling Project

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

We will use a training and testing dataset and we will use three prediction models: Random Forests, Decision Tree and Generalized Boosted and the one with higher accuracy will be used for the prediction.
